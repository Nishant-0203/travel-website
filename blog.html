                <p class="card-text">Standing tall and proud at 1,249 metres above sea level, Jebel Hafit is one of the highest peaks in the United Arab Emirates that dates thousands of years back. The stronghold of the peak gracefully compliments the panoramic views of the UNESCO Heritage city of Al Ain while the sunrise and sunset break the light on to it. Jebel Hafit not only choreographs a picture-perfect pose for your camera but also takes you on a cultural ride amidst the surreal snapshots of nature.
                    The culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it is an integral part of Indian culture. It is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad. It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people.It was elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures.However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions.
